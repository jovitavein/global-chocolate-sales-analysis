Global Chocolate Sales Analysis (January 3 – August 31, 2022)  

Project Overview  
This project analyzes chocolate sales data from January 3 to August 31, 2022. The goal is to explore factors that influence chocolate sales, identify potential new markets, and forecast future profit opportunities based on historical data.  

Objectives  
-Analyze total sales and product popularity  
-Investigate the relationship between logistics (boxes shipped) and revenue  
-Identify seasonal trends and monthly peaks  
-Pinpoint countries with high depression rates that may represent new target markets  
-Forecast future chocolate sales using predictive modeling  

Tools & Technologies  
-Python (Pandas, Numpy,  Statsmodels.api, Matplotlib.pyplot, Seaborn, Sklearn.linear_model) – for data analysis and visualization  
-Jupyter Notebook – for interactive analysis  
-Git & GitHub – for version control and sharing the project  

Key Insights  
-Most purchases range between $1–15,000, with only a few outliers beyond that.  
-A total of $6,183,625 in chocolate was sold across 1094 orders.  
-The peak in sales was recorded in January, aligning with potential seasonal depression effects.  
-Australia, UK, India, and USA were the top-performing markets.  
-A linear regression model showed a weak correlation between the number of boxes shipped and the total sale amount—indicating that high volume does not always mean high revenue.  
-Based on depression statistics and economic potential, 15 new countries were identified as promising markets.  

Predictive Modeling  
Using a projected annual growth rate of 12%, future sales for 2026 were estimated for current top countries. Results highlight increasing demand and suggest where to focus future marketing efforts.
